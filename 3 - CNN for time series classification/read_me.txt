The aim of this project is to experiment with a typical 
convolutional neural network (CNN) for a time series data.

I am going to base our code in this exercise project on this tutorial:
https://keras.io/examples/timeseries/timeseries_classification_from_scratch

The link for the dataset: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/isabbaggin/transaction-fraudulent-financial-syntheticdata




PART 1
First of all, I analysed the quality of the dataset:
01 - Evaluating dataset quality
01 - sweetviz_report
01 - ydata report
+ DataPrep report

PART 2
Secondly,
02 - Data Engineering
Making all data numeric and inspection of unnecessary columns which can be dropped

PART 3
03 - CNN for time series classification.ipynb
In this notebook:  
Scale the values (important in CNN)  
Split the DataFrame into timesteps  
The train/test split  
Develop the model with the EarlyStop
Train the model
Metrics evaluation

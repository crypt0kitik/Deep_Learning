In this project, I used a dataset about heart disease.

The link to the dataset is: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdimran6666/heart-disease-nowadays

The target variable is HeartDisease â€“ yes or no. There are 17 columns with different variables that affect whether a person is prone to having heart disease or may already have it.

Project structure:

I implemented Ydata, DataPrep tools, and performed EDA to clean the data.
I balanced all the data except for the binary variables.
I created 4 different neural networks, changing something in each one.
I created a logistic regression model to compare results and understand what worked better in this case: traditional machine learning or the neural networks I implemented.
Below you can find the changes I made when implementing the neural networks:

Neural network 1: Original :)
Neural network 2: Changed loss='mse' to loss='categorical_crossentropy' and added metrics=['accuracy']
Neural network 3: Experimented with layers
Neural network 4: Added early stopping


In your dataset, the target variable appears to be HeartDisease, 
which likely indicates whether a patient has heart disease (Yes or No). 
This suggests a binary classification problem.

Hello!

First of all, I cleaned the data and developed a neural network in the “ANN for regression” file.

Secondly, I tried a classic ML algorithm with the same dataset in the “Linear regression” file to see whether linear regression works better in this case.

Thirdly, I created the “Optimizations” files (1-4), which have different endings depending on the methods used, to experiment with various possible modifications to the neural network to see if I could achieve better results.

Finally, just for experimentation, I tried Ridge regression to see if I could obtain better results.

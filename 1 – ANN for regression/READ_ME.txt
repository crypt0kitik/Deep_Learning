Hello!

First of all, I cleaned data and developed a neural network in the "ANN for regression" file.
Secondly, I tried the classic ML algorythm with the same dataset to see whether the Linear regression works better in this case in the "Linear regression" file.
Thirdly, I created the Optimizations files, which have different endings depending on the used methods, to experiment with different possible modifications for the neural network to see if I can get better results.
